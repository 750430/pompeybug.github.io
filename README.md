# How the site works

The PCF website is built using text-based files using a language called markdown.

These are compiled into HTML using a system called Jekyll.

A distributed revision control system is used to manage different versions, but one version in particular is special.  The version that is pushed to github is the one that is live on the web.

Github Repo: https://github.com/pompeybug/pompeybug.github.io.git

We welcome volunteers to help improve the site and contribute content.
