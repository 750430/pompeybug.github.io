Portsmouth Cycle Forum is an independent cycle campaign group in Portsmouth.  We believe that Portsmouth is a great place to live and to cycle.  The city is flat, compact and the climate is warm.  We’re only a few miles from the South Downs and New Forest national parks and a short hop by ferry to the Isle of Wight.  All of these offer fantastic riding with tangled masses of quiet lanes to explore.

Portsmouth itself is one of the most densely populated places in the UK. It is also on an island, connected to the mainland by only 3 roads: making it very congested at times.  This means that the rate of cycling in the city is low as many people feel that it is too dangerous.

We are working hard to change this.  We’re building close relationships with the city council to help them design schemes that really help cyclists.  Cycling is a great opportunity for Portsmouth to become a healthier, cleaner and more liveable city.

Looking at other sussessful cycling cities and drawing from our diverse membership we have developed a strong cycling strategy, called [A City to Share](http://acitytoshare.org).

Portsmouth Cycle Forum welcomes individuals and representatives of organisations who are interested in cycling and related issues in the Portsmouth area.

* We campaign for the improvement of safety, convenience and practicality of cycling.
* We encourage discussion among those who influence cycling in Portsmouth and among others who may be affected by it.
* We are interested in all aspects of cycling in Portsmouth.
* We meet formally every two months at venues across the city.

Between open meetings, a committee meets monthly and puts into effect the actions taken during open meetings.
