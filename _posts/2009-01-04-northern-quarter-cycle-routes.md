The Northern Quarter is the name given to the proposed retail development to the north of Portsmouth City Centre which includes the site of the former Tricorn Centre.

Portsmouth Cycle Forum consider the proposed changes to the road layout in the plan by developers Centros

do not provide sufficient access for cyclists.

Some simple, cost-effective changes could be made to give a serious boost to cycling in the city, improve the environment, reduce traffic congestion and help make this a fitter, healthier city.

The current scheme gives little incentive to anyone to get out of their cars and onto their bikes.

We have produced two documents which detail the shortcomings together with our proposals for improvements.

With Centros currently re-designing

the scheme,

there exists

an ideal opportunity to make changes for the better.

Our proposal documents may be found below.
