Portsmouth City Council have been reviewing their inventory of pedestrian subways and underpasses with a view to closing some of them in order to save on maintenance charges. Since many underpasses are also used by cyclists (legally!), we decided to conduct a survey of our own.

The results are attached in the document below. Generally we found that most of the remaining underpasses are still of use to both pedestrians and cyclists although they are not always pleasant places. We'd like to see a programme of environmental and lighting improvements to make them more attractive and safer to use.
