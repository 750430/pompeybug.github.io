#Summary

[This consultation](http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/open/infrastructuredesign/consultationpaper) seeks views on the contents of the draft Cycling Infrastructure Design document. It is likely to be of interest to all local highway authorities, highway consultants and cycling organisations.

Published date|13 August 2007
Closing date for comments|05 November 2007

I have only glanced over the contents so far, but it appears to be very comprehensive and something that we should become familiar with.

If the table of contents is anything to go by, commitment to this by PCC would mean that all our concerns would be met.
