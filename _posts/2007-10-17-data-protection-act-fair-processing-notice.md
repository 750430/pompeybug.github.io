Portsmouth Cycle Forum is a not for profit organisation.

 It is thus exempt from registering under the Data Protection Act 1998 but is required to meet the other requirements of the Act.

Personal Data will be kept only for the purpose of allowing participants or potential future participants to be notified of forum activites and to communicate with each other.

This data will comprise no more than names, addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses.

Data will not be disclosed to any other party unless there is a legal obligation to do so.
