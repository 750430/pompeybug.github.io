We will be holding our annual general meeting  4th March where elections will be held for the officers and committee members for 2010/11\.  If you'd like to join the committee then please follow the link below. 

The formal business will form only a small part of the evening and we will have a full agenda  including an update on cycle theft from Hampshire Constabulary. The meeting will take place in Room 1 on the 3rd floor of Portsmouth Guildhall starting at  7pm.

Note too that subscriptions for the coming year are due on 1 April!
