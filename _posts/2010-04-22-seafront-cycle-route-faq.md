In response to the lively public debate about the virtues of the new seafront cycle route we have produced a set of frequently asked questions and answers to address some of the most common concerns.Â  The document can be found in our infrastructure section or by clicking [this link](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/infrastructure/seafront-cycle-route/).

Portsmouth's Cycle Forum believes that the new cycle route makes a massively positive contribution to the seafront and the city and is in whole hearted support of it.  If you haven't tried it yet then we can only suggest you get your bike out and go for a ride.
