Alex Bentley, PCC executive member for traffic and transport, was asked to approve recommendations on this subject at a decision meeting on 19 September.

The methodology proposed for evaluating the need for such schemes and the feasibility of implementing them took no account of cycling.

 Link to the paper below.

John Holland and Paul Dawson made a deputation on behalf of the forum to draw attention to the need to evaluate the impact on cycling in this case and in the development of other highway schemes.

 They suggested that there should be a presumption that all one way streets should be provided with cycle contra-flows.

Charles Stunell, head of traffic and street management agreed with this.

 There is a target in the Portsmouth Cycling Strategy (see link below) to provide contra-flow cycle facilities on all non-classified residential one-way streets by 2015.

<p>This would be a good time to draw to the council
