**Phase 1 Plans Revealed**

Portsmouth Cycle Forum was invited to look at the draft drawings of the first phase of the cycle route along Southsea seafront. This section extends from South Parade Pier to Henderson Road along Southsea Esplanade and Eastney Esplanade.

Having seen these drawings and after clarification on some of the plans, we submitted our comments to councillors for consideration.

**Our concerns**

We are particularly concerned that cycle lanes are shown to pass directly behind the echelon car parking for much of the way.  In our view this is very dangerous since drivers reversing from them simply cannot see cyclists approaching.

We are also concerned that the route is designed for experienced cyclists only.

Anyone new to cycling or returning to cycling will be reluctant to negotiate busy roads with parked cars. This is not a good proposal for children and other vulnerable cyclists.
