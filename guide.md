1. Install software
	1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) - git is a revision control system that can manage different versions of files on your machine, and synchronise files and versions between machines. 
	1. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) - Jekyll reads plain text files and turns them into HTML.  It makes building non-interactive websites much easier, and enables them to be tested without being connected to the web.
	1. [Install Atom](https://atom.io/docs/latest/getting-started-installing-atom) - Atom is a text editor.  Perfect for writing web pages - if you already have a favourite text editor, use that instead.

2. Choose where you want the website source to live.  e.g. if you keep all websites in a websites folder: `cd websites`

3. Use git to get a local copy of the website.
	1. Open a command prompt.
	3. Create a local copy of the repository:
	`git clone https://github.com/pompeybug/pompeybug.github.io.git`
